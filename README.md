# SQL_analysis_of_Pizza_Sales
I applied SQL to analyze a pizza sales dataset, uncovering valuable insights into customer preferences and business performance.
🔍 *Key Insights Delivered*:
🍕💰 Total orders and revenue generated from pizza sales  
🏆 Identified the most popular and highest-priced pizzas  
🍕📏 Analyzed pizza size preferences and order distribution by time  
📊 Top 5 most ordered pizzas and their contribution to revenue  
📈 Distribution of orders across categories and cumulative revenue trends  

💡 Through this project, I enhanced my skills in SQL for database querying, data aggregation, and optimization. This project demonstrated how data-driven insights can inform strategic decisions for businesses.
